The recipe

DOUGH :
add 2 cups whole wheat flour (atta), salt, oil and water in a bowl and knead it.

STUFFING :

Peel the boiled potatoes and mash it.
(On a medium flame cook the potatoes in the water for 3 to 4 whistles.
When the pressure settles down on its own in the cooker, remove the lid.
Drain the water and allow the potatoes to become warm.)

Add the green chilli paste to the potatoes,
Add red chilli powder,
Add garam masala,
squeeze the lemon into the mixture,
add salt,
add chopped coriander,
add turmeric,
mix well

METHOD TO STUFF:
Pinch a medium ball dough. Roll between your palms and lightly flatten it.
Dust with some flour and roll it to a circle of about 5 to 5.5 inches diameter.
Place the potato stuffing in the center, keeping about 2 to 2.5 inches space from the sides.

ROASTING:
Sprinkle some flour and roll this version of stuffed paratha to about the same size as that of a chapati or roti.
In case if the filling comes out, then just take a small piece of dough and cover the gap.
Roll to smoothen out the small piece of dough. Try keeping the same thickness throughout while rolling the dough.

Cook the parathas on tawa/pan.
Spread some ghee on the partly cooked part. You can also use oil instead of ghee.
